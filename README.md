# For precious groupmates that is contributing to this project:

## Please DO NOT commit directly, as we want to ensure all features are working in the main branch:
    (DON'T DO THIS ON THE MAIN BRANCH) git commit
### Always create a pull request and merge it to the main branch after review.
    1. git branch <branch-name>
### After finishing coding and decided to ask for an update:
    2. git commit (make sure you are NOT IN THE MAIN BRANCH)
### Then, in the branch you are editing, create a pull request in GitHub.
    You can go to pull request #2 (closed) and see the details need to be noted during creating a pull request.
#### OR, you can do the following command and push to the main branch
    3. git checkout main
    4. git merge <branch-name> (ONLY DO THIS WHEN YOU ARE SURE THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS WITH THE MAIN BRANCH)
